##Background Information:
Our software engineering project was to create a system that would allow a health inspector to conduct and perform health inspections
for food establishments efficiently and digitally. Currently, the health inspector manually inputs data from health inspections on paper,
and would like a system where he can perform inspections via tablet, be able to print inspections real time, and view inspection data via
desktop. Our system works the following way. The health inspector receives a tablet running the android operating system. We install our
android application onto the tablet. The health inspector uses the android application to either create a new inspection, or update a previous inspection, and print this inspection using a portable bluetooth printer. Then the inspector can connect the tablet via usb to his desktop, and sync the inspections to the desktop application. From the desktop application, the health inspector can view past inspections, and download them as pdfs.

##Architecture:
The architecture is as followed. Our code is organized into two categories: android and desktop. The android folder contains all code that allows the android application to run. We have used android studio to create our application. Currently the data is hardcoded into the application, and eventually will be replaced with a local SQLlite database. The desktop category refers to the code that creates the desktop application, and database that the desktop application is using. The database is coded in SQLite while, the desktop application is a java gui.


##Android Application:
The android application works the following way. The android application consists of a home screen where the health inspector can do the following:
1. Create inspection
2. Search inspection
3. View MA Food Codes
4. View Federal Food Codes

- No problems exist
- You made it all up
 1. You probably missing something big
     - That isn't really important though
     - I don't mean to pry
 2. You might have just not indented enough times
     - That seems more likely
- This helps, right?
