##Background Information:
Our software engineering project was to create a system that would allow a health inspector to conduct and perform health inspections
for food establishments efficiently and digitally. Currently, the health inspector manually inputs data from health inspections on paper,
and would like a system where he can perform inspections via tablet, be able to print inspections real time, and view inspection data via
desktop. Our system works the following way. The health inspector receives a tablet running the android operating system. We install our
android application onto the tablet. The health inspector uses the android application to either create a new inspection, or update a previous inspection, and print this inspection using a portable bluetooth printer. Then the inspector can connect the tablet via usb to his desktop, and sync the inspections to the desktop application. From the desktop application, the health inspector can view past inspections, and download them as pdfs.
