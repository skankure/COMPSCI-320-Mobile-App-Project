##Background Information:
Our software engineering project was to create a system that would allow a health inspector to conduct and perform health inspections
for food establishments efficiently and digitally. Currently, the health inspector manually inputs data from health inspections on paper,
and would like a system where he can perform inspections via tablet, be able to print inspections real time, and view inspection data via
desktop.
